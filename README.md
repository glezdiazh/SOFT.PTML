Background:

González-Díaz et al. coined the term NIFPTML = Network Invariant (NI) + Information Fusion (IF) + Perturbation Theory (PT) + Machine Learning (ML) to describe data analysis and multi-objective decission making strategies/algorithm for the training/validation of multi-output models for multi-objective optimization in input/output multi-label problems using information from multiple sensors/sources. It means, NIFPTML models can be used for multiple objective optimization/decission makig in the design, study, operation, or construction of a system/process by predicting with the same model multiple-ouputs for the same process/target system. NIFPTML takes into consideration that this target system/process may has multiple subsystems and/or may be composed by multiple process steps/phases each one with multiple ouput/input variables and multiple conditional labelling variables. As the name indicates NIFPTML algorithms include four main steps Network Invariant (NI) + Information Fusion (IF) + Perturbation Theory (PT) + Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AI/ML).

Network Invariant (NI): NI-phase focus on the conceptualization of the system as a network-like structured system susceptible of being represented/studied as a complex system with at leas one or more sub-systems that can be represented as networks/graphs and studied with graph theory. This stage includes the calculation of multiple invariants (numerical parameters) such as mean properties, spectral moments, entropies, centralities, etc. that will be used to quantify the structure of the system. Typical network-like systems and their graphs representations are drugs molecular graphs, proteins contact map networks, metabolic pathway networks, protein interaction networks, brain co-activation networks, production plants networks, disease spreading and social networks, etc.

Information Fusion (IF): In this phase the algorithm performs the IF of all the information about different sub-systems or steps of the process collected from different sources. This phase also includes data pre-processing, data-rearragement, data engineering, missing data treatment, surrogate/synthetic data stages. IF phase finish with the creation of the working dataset. 

Perturbation Theory (PT): This dataset uses as input the working dataset created in IF phase. PT phase begins with the conceptualization of all input variables as structural descriptors (Dk), non-structural enviromental/process input/output variables, conditioning/labeling variables of all subsystems. PT phase finish with the calculation of multiple PT Operators (PTOs) used to quantify the input/output perturbations in target systems/process with respect to cases/populations of reference.

Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AI/ML): Last AI/ML phase uses as input the PTOs to train/validate the AI/ML predictive algorithms and perform the prediction or properties and decission making on the design, discovery, or multi-objective optimization of the target system/process.

NIFPTML algorithms have been used in medicinal chemistry, proteomics, metabolomics, and nanotechnology, by different researchers. Typical systems/process studed with IFPTML algorithms are multi-objective decissin making in Drug Discovery (Anti-cancer, Anti-bacterial, Anti-parasites ... compounds screening), Fuel Production Plants (Fuel blending, Gasoline compoundig, Biofuel mixtures, Biofuel production protein enzymes...) optimization, Nanoparticle design (Anti-cancer co-therapy, Dual Activity Nanoparticles, ...), Materials properties optimization (Zeolites, Carbon based energy cells, etc.), Vaccine/Biomarkers design or discovery, etc. 

IFPTML begins with a first phase (IF) dedicated to carry out compilation and fusion of information of each sub-system or process step from different sources. 

Next the algorithm continues with the second phase (PT) focused on the transformation of the original values of the ouput variables vij into an objective function f(vij)obs and the orignal input variables into PT operators PTOs(Dk, cj). These PTOs are new input variables useful to codify at the same time information about the structural descriptors of the system Dkand multiple assay conditions cjfrom different sources. For instance, you can use PTOs to codify information about protein target, cell lines, microbial metabolic networks of target organism, nanoparticle carrier of the drug, etc. 

Last, IFPTML workflow enters into the ML phase that uses classic ML algorithms. 

Nevertheless, the process of development of this first IFPTML model and it posterior use for decission making was not implemented in a single software until recently. Until recently, the researchers aimed to training IFPTML models needed to run different software for each one of the different stages (IF, PT, and ML) of the algorithm. They needed to use calculation sheet/scripts to run the first phase, ML software/libraries to seek the model, and calculation sheet/scripts again to run predictions. 

This problem called the attention of software developers over the necessity of new platforms unifiying different steps of IFPMTL analysis. In fact, Ambure, Halder, González-Díaz, and Cordeiro introduced  QSAR-Co tool in order to solve some problems on this regard. QSAR-Co and posterior QSAR-CO-X version released to GitHub by Halder and Cordeiro (https://github.com/ncordeirfcup/QSAR-Co-X) are based on PTML algorithms an consequently run both PT and ML stages of the algorithm altogether. However, QSAR-Co is not able to run IF procedures for calculating multi-label PTOs able to encode multiple assay conditions/labels of different sub-systems/process at the same time. Strictly speaking, QSAR-Co models use a PTML algorithm and not an IFPTML algorithm able to perform IF phase. QSAR-Co only calculates one class of PT operators called single condition moving averages. Consequently, it needs as many PTOs as boundary conditions present on the problem. This implies a notably higher number of variables to be explored with respect to multi-label PTOs. 

Accordingly, Ortega-Tenezaca and González-Díaz introduced SOFT.PTML studio tool; this time including the possibility of calculating multi-label PTOs. This includes multi-label/multi-condition reference functions, moving averages, co-variances, etc. These PTOs, not present in QSAR-Co, have been very useful in order to reduce problem dimensionality in other problems. In fact, SOFT.PTMLhas been successfully used in IFPTML modeling nanotechnology and medicinal chemistry for this purpose as well.
